# Text-based Snakes 'n Ladders

## v.0.1.5

Entire game pretty much works now, random number generator is still outputting same numbers however

___Version notes:__ use better RNG and add more functionality_

## v0.1.4

Near complete version of the game

___Version notes:__ gotta hand player control to the player (i.e. dice rolls) and print status after every turn_

## v0.1.3

Creating the board now works

___Version notes:__ create driver for the game and add user input and modes_

## v0.1.2

Implemented `std::vectors` but snakes and ladders are not being added to the vectors yet

___Version notes:__ Fix that_

## v0.1.1

___Version notes:__ Code is still deeply broken. Will have to look into the use of `std::vectors` instead of arrays and `new[]`_

## v0.1

This is probably been done before but well, this is my take on it and also to practice my object-oriented in C++.  

`Board.cpp`, `Snakes.cpp`, `Ladder.cpp` and `Player.cpp` are necessary classes to run this (can't have Snakes and Ladders without snakes or ladders anyways, right?)

___Version notes:__ need to add a driver to run all of those classes, and fill in those functions_
