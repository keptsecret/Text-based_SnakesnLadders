# Text-based Snakes 'n Ladders

## v0.1

This is probably been done before but well, this is my take on it and also to practice my object-oriented in C++.  

`Board.cpp`, `Snakes.cpp`, `Ladder.cpp` and `Player.cpp` are necessary classes to run this (can't have Snakes and Ladders without snakes or ladders anyways, right?)

___Version notes:__ need to add a driver to run all of those classes, and fill in those functions_
